# Thoughts

- The multi-role camera modes keep the experience grounded in how real crews operate: driver for navigation, gunner for aim, commander for awareness.
- SVG textures give a stylized blueprint feel and make it easy to iterate the tank's look without external asset pipelines.
- Extending SVG textures to environment props makes the battlefield feel cohesive and art-directable, especially once color management is dialed in.
- The shader-driven terrain should evolve into a biomes system, with distinct audio and particle feedback.
- Keeping the collision logic tied to shader math avoids mismatches between visuals and gameplay.
- The SVG skybox plus lighting cycle communicates time-of-day shifts without heavy environment assets.
