- The multi-role camera modes keep the experience grounded in how real crews operate: driver for navigation, gunner for aim, commander for awareness.
- SVG textures give a stylized blueprint feel and make it easy to iterate the tank's look without external asset pipelines.
- The voxel terrain opens the door for destruction, cover gameplay, and more tactile level design.
- With destructible terrain, props need to be tied to the voxel surface so they can cleanly disappear or react to impacts.
